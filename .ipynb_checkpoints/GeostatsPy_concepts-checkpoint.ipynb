    "#### Motivation for Geostatistics Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "You could just open up a Jupyter notebook in Python and start building spatial geostatistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternatively, many \"canned software\" programs have geostatistics built in and often have *reasonable* default parameters to build spatial models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are many sources of code examples, including this e-book and my many well-documented Python workflows in my [GeostatsPyDemos](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPyDemos) repository in my GitHub account that you could copy and paste and update for your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, you could Google a question about using a specific geostatistical algorithm in Python and the top results may include [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) questions and responses, it is truly amazing how much experienced coders are willing to give back and share their knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We truly have an amazing scientific community with the spirit of knowledge sharing and open-source development. Respect. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Of course, you could learn a lot about geostatistics from a machine learning large language model (LLM) like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). Not only will ChatGPT answer your questions, but it will also provide codes and help you debug them when you tell ChatGPT what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way or the other you obtained and added this code to you data science workflow (taken from my [GeostatsPy_kriging] workflow  at https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPyDemos/blob/main/GeostatsPy_kriging.ipynb),\n",

    "et voil√†, you have a kriged map that could be applied to make predictions for new spatial samples and to assess resources, etc., and support some important development decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "* But, is this a good model? Did we do something wrong with the input parameters that we didn't understand?\n",
    "* How good is it? Could it be improved?\n",
    "* Wait, should we actually use kriging for this problem? Or should we use simulation? Or maybe just a spreadsheet!\n",
    "\n",
    "Without knowledge about basic geostatistics concepts we can't answer these questions and build the best possible models. In general, I'm not an advocate for black box modeling, because it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. likely to lead to mistakes that may be difficult to detect and correct\n",
    "2. incompatible with the expectations for compentent practice for professional engineers. I gave a talk on [Applying Machine Learning as a Compentent Engineer or Geoscientist](https://youtu.be/W_ZDg1Wb2vM?si=DF-n1E4-ik2ukLfF)\n",
    "3. not fun to do. Do you remember those early days playing the guitar or participating in a martial art? Is it not more fun when we see our our personal growth and gain confidence in the things that we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you \"look under the hood\", this chapter provides you with the basic knowledge to answer these questions and to make better, more reliable geostatistical models. Let's start building this essential foundation with some general definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone hears that data science needs a lot of data. In fact, so much data that it is called \"big data\", but how do you know if you are working with big data? The criteria for big data are these 'V's, if upon reflection you answer \"yes\" for at least some of these, then you are working with big data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Volume**: many data samples, difficult to handle and visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Velocity**: high rate collection, continuous relative to decision making cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variety**: data form various sources, with various types and scales\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variability**: data acquisition changes during the project\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Veracity**: data has various levels of accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, most spatial and subsurface-focussed, engineers and (geo)scientists answer yes to all of these questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* So I proudly say that we in space or specifically the subsurface have been big data long before the tech sector learned about big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In fact, I state that we in the subsurface resource industries are the original data scientists. I'm getting ahead of myself, more on this in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if I get carried away with hubris, rest assured this e-book is written for anyone interested to learn about geostatistics. You can skip the short sections on subsurface data science or read along if interested. Now that we know big data, let's talk about the big topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Subsurface engineers and geoscientists:\n",
    ":class: remove-from-content-only\n",
    "\n",
    "work with big data and we are the original data scientists!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistics, Geostatistics and Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is collecting, organizing, and interpreting data, as well as drawing conclusions and making decisions. If you look up the definition of data analytics you will find criteria that include statistical analysis, and data visualization to support decision making. I'm going to call it, data analytics and statistics are the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can append, geostatistics, as a branch of applied statistics that accounts for: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the spatial (geological) context\n",
    "2. the spatial relationships \n",
    "3. volumetric support\n",
    "4. uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember all those statistics classes with the assumption of independent, identically distributed (remember the i.i.d.s everywhere?). Spatial phenomenon don't do that, so we developed a unique branch of statistics to address this. \n",
    "\n",
    "* By our assumption above, we can state that geostatistics is the same as spatial data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's use a Venn diagram to visualize statistics / data analytics and geostatistics / spatial data analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"_static/concepts/Venn_stats.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 60%;\">\n",
    "  <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Venn diagram for statistics and geostatistics.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can add our previously discussed big data to our Venn diagram resulting in big data analytics and spatial big data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"_static/concepts/Venn_big_data.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 60%;\">\n",
    "  <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Venn diagram for statistics and geostatistics with big data added.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, geostatistics is actually spatial data analytics, or more generally, let's call it spatial data science. Now, let's talk a bit about data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "If no one else has said this to you, let me have the honor of welcoming you to the fourth paradigm for scientific discovery, data-driven scientific discovery or shortenned as data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The paradigms for scientific discovery are distinct stages or approaches for humanity to develop science.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the fourth paradigm let's compare to the previous three paradigms. Here's all of the four paradigms with dates for important developments during each,\n",
    "\n",
    "| 1st Paradigm Empirical Science | 2nd Paradigm Theoretical Science | 3rd Paradigm Computational Science | 4th Paradigm Data Science | \n",
    "|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| Experiments                    | Models and Laws                  | Numerical Simulation               | Learning from Data        |\n",
    "| 430 BC Empedocles proved air has substance | 1011 AD al-Haytham Book of Optics | 1942 Manhattan Project | 2009 Hey et al. Data-Intensive Book |\n",
    "| 230 BC Eratosthenes measure Earth‚Äôs diameter | 1687 AD Newton Principia | 1980 ‚Äì Global Forecast System (GFS) | 2015 AlphaGo beats a professional Go player |\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can argue about the boundaries between the paradigms for scientific discovery, i.e., when did a specific paradigm begin? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Certainly the Mesopotamians (4000 BC - 3500 BC) conducted many first paradigm experiments that supported their development of the wheel, plow, chariot, weaving loom, and irrigation and on the other side we can trace the development of artificial neural networks to McColloch and Pitts in 1943.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, the adoption of a new scientific paradigm is a major societal shift that does not occur uniformly around the globe. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what caused the fourth paradigm to start some time between 1943 and 2009? The fundamental mathematics of data driven models have been available for a long time, as demonstrated by the following mathematical and statistical developments in history,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Calculus** - Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed the math to find minimums and maximums during the 1600s with \"Methods of Fluxions\" 1671 (published posthumously in 1736), and with \"Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis\" published in 1684.\n",
    "* **Bayesian Probability** - introduced by Reverend Thomas Bayes with Bayes' Theorem enshrined in \"An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\" published posthumously in 1763\n",
    "* **Linear Regression** - formalized by Marie Legendre in 1805\n",
    "* **Discriminant Analysis** - developed by Ronald Fisher in his 1939 paper \"The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems\"\n",
    "* **Monte Carlo Simulation** - pioneered by Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann in the early 1940's as part of the Manhattan Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon reflection, one could ask, why didn't the fourth paradigm start before the 1940's and even in the 1800s? What changed? The answer is that other critical developments provided the fertile ground for data science, including cheap and available compute and big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cheap and Available Compute\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following developments in computers,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine** (1837) is often credited as the first computer, yet is was a mechanical device the attempted to implement many modern concepts such as arithmetic logic, control flow and memory, but it was never completed given the challenges with the available technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Konrad Zuse's Z3** (1941) and **ENIAC** (1945) the first digital, programmable computers, but they were programmed by labor-intensive and time-consuming rewiring of plug boards with machine language as there was no high level programming language, the memory could fit 1,000 words limiting the program complexity and with 1000s of vacuum tubes cooling and maintenance was a big challenge. These unreliable machines were very slow with only about 5,000 additions per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transistors** were invented in 1947 the transistor replaced the vacuum tubes greatly improving energy-efficiency, miniaturization, speed and reliability. Resulting in the second generation computers such as **IBM 7090** and **UNIVAC 1108**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integrated Circuits** were developed in the 1960s allowed for multiple transistors to be placed on a single chip leading to third generation computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Microprocessors** - developed in 1971 integrated the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) enabling smaller, cheaper computers, resulting in the personal, home computer revolution including the **Apple II** (1977) and **IBM PC** (1981). Yes, when I was in grade 1 in elementary school we had a Apple II in my classroom, and it amazed all of us with the monochrome (orange and black pixels) monitor, floppy disk loaded programs (there was no hard drive) and beeps and clicks from the speaker! \n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a society with more compute power in our pockets (cell phones) than used to send the first astronauts to the moon and a SETI screen saver that uses home computers' idle time to search for extraterrestrial life! Now we are surrounded by cheap and reliable compute that our grandparents (and perhaps parents) could never have imagined. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you will learn in this e-book, geostatistical methods requires a lot of compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In fact, calculating spatial models relies on a large number of iterations, matrix or parallel operations, bootstrapping models, stochastic descent over large grids often in the 10s - 100s of millions of cells, with several features at each cell, and uncertainty modeling requires a lot of scenarios and realizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheap and available compute is an essential prerequisite for the fourth paradigm. Now consider the development of data science has been largely a crowd-source, open-source effort. There cannot be data science without many people having easy access to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Availability of Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "With small data we tend to rely on other sources of information such as physics, engineering and geoscience principals and then calibrate these models to the few available observations, as is common in applications of the second and third paradigm for scientific discovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "* With big data we can learn the full range of behaviors of natural systems from the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In fact, with big data we often see the limitations of the second and third paradigm models due to missing complexity in our solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, big data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* provides sufficient sampling to support the data-driven fourth paradigm\n",
    "  \n",
    "* and may actually preclude exclusive use of the second and third paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "These days big data is everywhere, with so much data now open-source and available online. Here's some great examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* satellite data with time lapse is widely available on [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/maps) and other platforms. Yes, this isn't the most up to date and highest resolution statelite imagery, but it is certainly sufficient for many land use, geomorphology and surface evolution studies. My team of graduate students use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* river gauges data over your state are generally available to the public. We use it for hydrologic analysis and also to determine great locations and times to paddle! Check out the [USGS's National Water Information System](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)\n",
    "\n",
    "* government databases, including the [United States Census](https://data.census.gov/) to [oil and gas production data](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/oil-and-gas/research-and-statistics/production-data/) are available to all\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is open, public data, but consider the fact that many industries are embracing smart, intelligent systems with enhanced connectivity, monitoring and control. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The result is an explosion of data supported by faster and cheaper computation, processing and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are all swimming in data that, once again, the generation before us could not have imagined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does anyone else go on [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) and explore new parts of our home planet? I have Google Earth for my HTC Vive Pro. I like to wander Skyrim, but often it is just as fun to explore our own Planet Earth in VR! So much data! We are so fortunate!\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could also talk about improved algorithms and hardware architectures optimized for data science, but I'll leave that out of scope for this e-book.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these developments have provided the fertile ground for the seeds of spatial data science, geostatistics, to grow and become standard practice for management for the spatial and often the subsurface, including,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mining developmental and critical minerals - in situ reosurces, development plan and reserves that maximize value and minimize environmental impact\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subsurface energy hydrocarbons, goethermal and hydrogen storage - in situ potential, development plan and reserves that maximize value and minimize environmental impact\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Groundwater resources - model aquifer volume, recharge, discharge and drawdown, to support groundwater management, mitigation and policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Forestry - model forest inventory, corbon sequestration, to support silviculture.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Shortly after Kolmogorov developed the fundamental probability axioms during the 1930s,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Danie Krige developed a set of statistical, spatial, i.e., data-driven tools for making estimates in space while accounting for spatial continuity and scale in the 1950s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. These tools were formalized with theory developed by Professor Matheron during the 1960s in a new science called geostatistics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Over the 1970s - 1990s the geostatistical methods and applications expanded from mining to address oil and gas, environmental, agriculture, fisheries, etc. with many important open source developments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why was subsurface engineering and geoscience earlier in the development of data science? Because, necessity is the mother of invention! \n",
    "\n",
    "* Complicated, heterogeneous, sparsely sampled, vast systems with complicated physics and high value decisions drove us to data-driven methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast this with the many other engineering fields that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* work with homogeneous phenomenon that does not have significant spatial heterogeneity, continuity, nor uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "* have exhaustive sampling of the population relative to the modeling purpose and do not need an estimation model with uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "* have well understood physics and can model the entire system with second and third paradigm phenomenon\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* how the measure is made changes the veracity (level of certainty in the measure) and different methods actually may results in different results so we may need to reconcile multiple measurement methods of the same thing, so we often store each vintage as separate features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the scale of the measure is very important due to volume variance effect, with increasing support volume (sample size) the variance reduces due to volumetric averaging resulting in regression to the mean.

    "\n",
    "Data science is all about estimating such models, $\\hat{ùëì}$, for two purposes, inference or prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inference and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference must precede prediction, because inference is going from the limited sample to a model of the population. Inference is learning about the system, $\\hat{f}$, for example,\n",

    "* what feature are most important?\n",
    "* what are the complicated interactions between all the features?\n",

    "A good example of a inferential problem is imagine if I walk in the room and pull a coin out of my pocket and flip it 10 times and get 3 heads and 7 tails and then ask you, \"Is this is a fair coin?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* you take the sample, the results from 10 coin tosses, to make an inference about the population, i.e., whether the coin is fair or not? Note, in this example the coin is the population!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have completed our inference to model the population from the sample, we are ready to use the model of the population to predict future samples. This is prediction, going from a model of the population to estimating new samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "* the goal of prediction is to get the most accurate estimates of future samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carrying on with our coin example, if you declare that my coin was biased towards tails (a weighted coin would be a useful teaching tool!) with a 70% probability of tails, now you are able to predict the outcome for the next 10 coin tosses, even before I toss the coin again. This is prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know if you are doing inferential or predictive machine learning. In general, inferential machine learning is conducted only with the predictor features, also known as **unsupervised machine learning** (because there are no response labels). Examples includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **cluster analysis** - that learns ways to split the data into multiple distinct populations to improve the subsequent models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dimensionality reduction** - that projects the predictor features to a reduced number of new features that better describe the system with less noise\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're doing predictive machine learning you have both the predictor and the response feature(s), so we call it **supervised learning**. The model is trained and tuned to predict new samples. \n",

    "**Determinstic Model** - A model based on a mathematical algorithm that produces the same output each time it is used with the same input. For example, an interpolation method and a numerical physics-based flow simulation are both deterministic models, because if we rerun them for a specific case, the answer does not change. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. a best fit trend line, e.g., linear regression\n",
    "2. regression tree\n",
    "3. support vector machines\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Kriging is interesting, because it provides a single best estimate that doesn't change when we rerun it (no random number seed is applied), but it also provides a measure of uncertainty through the kriging estimation variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's still call kriging a deterministic model\n",

    "* global accuracy, matches the global statistics\n",
    "\n",
