    "This chapter is a summary of essential **Geostatistics Terminology**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation for Geostatistics Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, why do this? I have received the request for a course glossary from the students in my **Data Analytics and Geostatistics** undergraduate course. While I usually dedicated a definition slide in the lecture slide decks for salient terms, some of my students have requested course glossary, list of terminology in their course review. The e-book provides a great vehicle and motivation for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me begin with a confession. There is a [Geostatistical Glossary and Multilingual Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/Geostatistical-Multilingual-International-Association-Mathematical/dp/0195066898) written by my good friend [Dr. Ricardo A. Olea](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/ricardo-a-olea) an excellent geologist and statistician from the [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/). For those seeking the in depth, comprehensive list of geostatistical terms please use this book!\n",
    "\n",
    "* By writing my own I can limit the scope and descriptions to course content. I fear that many students would be overwhelmed by the size and mathematical notation of a standard geostatistics glossary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, by including a glossary in the e-book I can link from glossary entries to the chapters in the e-book for convenience. I will eventual populate all the chapters with hyperlinks to the glossary to enable moving back and forth between the chapters and the glossary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, like the rest of the book, I want the glossary to be a evergreen living document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Addition Rule** (probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): when we add probabilities (the union of outcomes), the probability of $A$ or $B$ is calculated with the probability addition rule,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A,B)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "given mutually exclusive events we can generalize the addition rule as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P\\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Affine Correction**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Distribution Transformations](GeostatsPy_transformations): a distribution rescaling that can be thought of as shifting, and stretching or squeezing of a univariate distribution (e.g., *histogram*). For the case of affine correction of $X$ to $Y$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x}(x_i - \\overline{x}) + \\overline{y}, \\quad \\forall \\quad i, \\ldots, n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{x}$ and $\\sigma_x$ are the original mean and variance, and $\\overline{y}$ and $\\sigma_y$ are the new mean and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see above that the affine correlation method first centers the distribution (by subtracting the original mean), then rescales the dispersion (distribution spread) by the ratio of the new standard deviation to the original standard deviation and then shifts the distribution to centered on the new mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* there is no shape change for affine correction. For shape change consider *Distribution Transformation* like *Gaussian Anamorphosis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Anisotropic or Directional** (variogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation): variogram calculated or modelled such that direction (azimuth) is considered,\n",
    "\n",
    "* for an anisotropic experimental variogram set the azimuth tolerance less than 90 degrees, then the experimental variogram is sensitive to direction\n",
    "\n",
    "* for an anisotropic variogram model set the major range greater than the minor range, then the variogram model is sensitive to direction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Azimuth Tolerance** (variogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation): for calculating directional experimental variograms, the tolerance $+/-\\Delta$ in azimuth applied to identify data pairs for that specific azimuth.\n",
    "\n",
    "* for example, given an azimuth of 90 degrees (along the positive x axis in map view), we could assign an azimuth tolerance of 20 degrees and then all pairs with azimuths between 70 degrees and 110 degrees will be pooled to calculate the experimental variogram for this azimuth\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general observations for setting azimuth tolerance,\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is common practice for directional experimental variograms to use a azimuth tolerance of 22.5 degrees, this result in a 45 degrees angle inscribed in the search window. This is seen as a good balance to provide smooth, interpretable experimental variograms without mixing spatial continuity information over too many directions\n",
    "  \n",
    "* may be increased to smooth the experimental variogram for improved interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "* for isotropic (also called omnidirectional) experimental variograms (not sensitive to direction) use an azimuth tolerance of 90.0, resulting in 180.0 degrees angle inscribed in the search window to remove the influence of direction\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bandwidth** (variogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation): the maximum orthogonal deviation from the lag vector when identifying data pairs to calculate an experimental variogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the motivation for using bandwidth?\n",
    "\n",
    "* when working with a cross section (axes, y is vertical and x is horizontal) at large lag distances, $\\bf{h}$, azimuth (dip) tolerance may result in including data from adjacent (mixing between) stratigraphic units.\n",
    "\n",
    "* bandwidth is typically applied to the vertical direction to reduce the potential for mixing between adjacent units\n",
    "\n",
    "When not to use bandwidth?\n",
    "\n",
    "* bandwidth should not be used to calculate isotropic (also called omnidirectional) experimental variograms\n",
    "\n",
    "* bandwidth is rarely used to calculate horizontal experimental variograms\n",
    "\n",
    "* bandwidth is removed by setting it very large relative to the model extent \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bayesian Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): probabilities based on a degree of belief (expert judgement and experience) in the likelihood of an event. The general approach,\n",
    "\n",
    "* start with prior probability, prior to the collection of new information\n",
    "\n",
    "* formulate a likelihood probability, based on new information alone \n",
    "\n",
    "* update prior with likelihood to calculate the updated posterior probability\n",
    "\n",
    "* continue to update as new information is available\n",
    "\n",
    "* solve probability problems that we cannot use simple frequencies, i.e., *frequentist probability* approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayesian updating is modeled with *Bayes' Theorem*\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bayes' Theorem** (probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): the mathematical model central to Bayesian probability for the Bayesian updating from prior probability, with likelihood probability from new information to posterior probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(A)$ is the prior, $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, $P(B)$ is the evidence term and $P(A|B)$ is the posterior. If is convenient to substitute more descriptive labels for $A$ and $B$ to better conceptualize this approach,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Model} | \\text{New Data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{New Data} | \\text{Model}) \\cdot P(\\text{Model})}{P(\\text{New Data})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "demonstrating that we are updating our model with new data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Big Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): you have big data if your data has a combination of these criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Data Volume* - many data samples and features, difficult to store, transmit and visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Data Velocity* - high-rate collection, continuous data collection relative to decision making cycles, challenges keeping up with the new data while updating the models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Data Variety* - data form various sources, with various types of data, types of information, and scales\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Data Variability* - data acquisition changes during the project, even for a single feature there may be multiple vintages of data with different scales, distributions, and veracity\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Data Veracity* - data has various levels of accuracy, the data is not certain \n",
    "\n",
    "For common subsurface applications most, if not all, of these criteria are met. Subsurface engineering and geoscience are often working with big data!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Big Data Analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): the process of examining large and varied data (*big data*) sets to discover patterns and make decisions, the application of statistics to big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bootstrap**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Distribution Transformations](GeostatsPy_transformations): a statistical resampling procedure to calculate uncertainty in a calculated statistic from the sample data itself. Some general comments,\n",
    "\n",
    "* *sampling with replacement* - $n$ (number of data samples) *Monte Carlo simulation*s from the dataset *cumulative distribution function*, this results in a new realization of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* *simulates the data collection process* - the fundamental idea is to simulate the original data collection process. Instead of actually collecting new sample sets, we randomly select from the data to get data realizations\n",
    "  \n",
    "* *bootstrap any statistic* - this approach is very flexible as we can calculate realizations of any statistics from the data realizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* *computationally cheap* - repeat this approach to get realizations of the statistic to build a complete distribution of uncertainty. Use a large number of realizations, $L$, for a reliable uncertainty model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *calculates the entire distribution of uncertainty* - for any statistic, you calculate any summary statistic for the uncertainty model, e.g., mean, P10 and P90 of the uncertainty in the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "* *bagging for machine learning* - is the application fo bootstrap to obtain data realizations to train predictive model realizations to aggregate predictions over ensembles of prediction models to reduce model variance\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the limitations of bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "* biased sample data will likely result in a biased bootstrapped uncertainty model, you must first debias the samples, e.g., *declustering*\n",
    "\n",
    "* you must have a sufficient sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "* integrates uncertainty due to sparse samples in space only\n",
    "\n",
    "* does not account for the spatial context of the data, i.e., sample data locations, volume of interest nor the spatial continuity. There is a variant of bootstrap called [spatial bootstrap](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/DataScienceInteractivePython/blob/main/Interactive_Spatial_Bootstrap.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a feature that can only take one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Nominal Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a *categorical* feature without any natural ordering, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* facies = {boundstone, wackystone, packstone, brecia}\n",
    "\n",
    "* minerals = {quartz, feldspar, calcite}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Ordinal Feature** \n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a *categorical* feature with a natural ordering, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* geologic age = {Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene} - ordered from older to younger rock\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mohs hardness = $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}$ - ordered from softer to harder rock\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cell-based Declustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Declustering to Correct Sampling Bias](GeostatsPy_declustering): a declustering method to assign weights to spatial samples based on local sampling density, such that the weighted statistics are likely more representative of the population. Data weights are assigned such that,\n",
    "\n",
    "* samples in densely sampled areas receive less weight\n",
    "\n",
    "* samples in sparsely sampled areas receive more weight\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of declustering is for the sample statistics to be independent of sample locations, e.g., infill drilling or blast hole samples should not change the statistics for the area of interest due to increased local sample density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell-based declustering proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a cell mesh is placed over the spatial data and weights are set as proportional to the inverse of the number of samples in the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the cell mesh size is varied, and the cell size that minimizes the declustered mean (in the sample mean is biased high) or maximizes the declustered mean (if the sample mean is biased low) is selected\n",
    "\n",
    "3. to remove the impact of cell mesh position, the cell mesh is randomly moved several times and the resulting declustering weights are averaged for each datum\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w(\\bf{u}_j) = \\frac{1}{n_l} \\cdot \\frac{n}{L_o}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_l$ is the number of data in the current cell, $L_o$ is the number of cells with data, and $n$ is the total number of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some highlights for cell-based declustering,\n",
    "\n",
    "* expert judgement to assign cell size based on the nominal sample spacing (e.g., data spacing before infill drilling) will improve the performance over the automated method for cell size selection based on minimum or maximum declustered mean (mentioned above)\n",
    "\n",
    "* cell-based declustering is not aware of the boundaries of the area of interest; therefore, data near the boundary of the area of interest may appear to be more sparsely sampled and receive more weight\n",
    "\n",
    "* cell-based was developed by Professor Andre Journel in 1983, {cite}`journel1983`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cloud Transform**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cosimulation](GeostatsPy_cosimulation): a cosimulation approach that is based on the bivariate relationship (scatter plot) between the primary and secondary features to simulated realizations of the primary feature, $z$, paired with a previously simulated realization of the secondary feature, $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "For all locations in the model, $\\alpha = 1, \\ldots, nx \\cdot ny$, $\\bf{u}_{\\alpha}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. find the collocated secondary value, $y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. calculate the conditional distribution, $f_{(z|y = y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})}(z)$, from the scatter plot-based joint distribution function, $f_{y,z}$, and the collocated secondary value, $y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. draw from $f_{(z|y = y(\\bf{u}_{\\alpha})}(z)$ with a field of correlated p-values (known as a p-field)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments about cloud transform,\n",
    "\n",
    "* prioritizes reproduction of the cloud, the bivariate relationship (scatter plot) between the primary and secondary features\n",
    "  \n",
    "* may not well reproduce the primary feature spatial continuity and distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "* cloud transform is very commonly used in practice to simulate permeability with secondary porosity realizations. Why? Permeability samples are quite sparsely sampled and as a result the permeability distribution and variogram are not often well-known, but the bivariate relationship often has recognizable forms and the porosity variogram and distribution are more reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "* the general approach of calculating simulated realizations by applying p-fields to local uncertainty distributions is called p-field simulation. It is often applied to simplify information integration through the separation of local conditioning and imposing spatial correlation, and as a faster simulation method to scale up to large models.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Continuous Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a feature that can take any value between a lower and upper bound. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* porosity = $\\{13.01\\%, 5.23\\%, 24.62\\%\\}$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Continuous, Interval Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a *continuous feature* where the intervals between numbers are equal, for example, the difference between 1.50 and 2.50 is the same as the difference between 2.50 and 3.50, but the actual values do not have an objective, physical reality (exist on an arbitrary scale), i.e., do not have a true zero point, for example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Celsius scale of temperature (an arbitrary scale based on water freezing at 0 and boiling at 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "* calendar year (there is no true zero year)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cognitive Biases**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): an automated (subconscious) thought process used by human brain to simplify information processing from large amount of personal experience and learned preferences. While these have been critical for our evolution and  survival on this planet, they can lead to the following issues in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Anchoring Bias*, too much emphasis on the first piece of information. Studies have shown that the first piece of information could be irrelevant as we are beginning to learn about a topic, and often the earliest data in a project has the largest uncertainty. Address anchoring bias by currating all data, integrating uncertainty, fostering open discussion and debate on your project team.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Availability Heuristic*, overestimate importance of easily available information, for example, grandfather smoked 3 packs a day and lived to 100 years old, i.e., relying on anecdotes. Address availability heuristic by ensuring the project team documents all available information and applies quantitative analysis to move beyond anecdotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Bandwagon Effect*, assessed probability increases with the number of people holding the same belief. Watch out for everyone jumping on board or the loudest voice influencing all others on your project teams. Encouraging all members of the project team to contribute and even separate meetings may be helpful to address bandwagon effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Blind-spot Effect*, fail to see your own cognitive biases. This is the hardest cognitive bias of all. One possible solution is to invite arms length review of your project team's methods, results and decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Choice-supportive Bias*, probability increases after a commitment, i.e., a decision is made. For example, it was good that I bought that car supported by focusing on positive information about the car. This is a specific case of confirmation bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Clustering Illusion*, seeing patterns in random events. Yes, this heuristic helped us stay alive when large predictors hunted us, i.e., false positives are much better than false negatives! The solution is to model uncertainty confidence intervals and test all data and results against random effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *Confirmation Bias*, only consider new information that supports current model. Choice-supportive bias is a specific case of confirmation bias. The solution to confirmation bias is to seek out people that you will likely disagree with and build skilled project teams that hold diverse technical opinions and have different expert experience. My approach is to get nervous if everyone in the room agrees with me! \n",
    "\n",
    "8. *Conservatism Bias*, favor old data to newly collected data. Data curation and quantiative analysis are helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. *Recency Bias*, favor the most recently collected data. Ensure your team documents previous data and choices to enhance team memory. Just like conservative bias, data curation and quantitative analysis are our first line of defense.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. *Survivorship Bias*, focus on success cases only. Check for any possible pre-selection or filters on the data available to your team.\n",
