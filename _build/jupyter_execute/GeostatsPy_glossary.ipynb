    "This chapter is a summary of essential **Geostatistics Terminology**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation for Geostatistics Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, why do this? I have received the request for a course glossary from the students in my **Data Analytics and Geostatistics** undergraduate course. While I usually dedicated a definition slide in the lecture slide decks for salient terms, I know my students would appreciate a single source. Also, since I've already written these out it should be pretty efficient to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me begin with a confession. There is a [Geostatistical Glossary and Multilingual Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/Geostatistical-Multilingual-International-Association-Mathematical/dp/0195066898) written by my good friend [Dr. Ricardo A. Olea](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/ricardo-a-olea) and excellent geologist and statistician from the [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/). For those seeking the indepth, complete list of geostatistical terms please use this book!\n",
    "\n",
    "* By writing my own I can limit the scope and descriptions to course content. Also, I will eventual populate all the chapters with hyperlinks to the glossary. Finally, like the rest of the book I want the glossary to be a evergreen living document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Addition Rule** (probablity)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): when we add probabilities (the union of outcomes), the probability of A or B is calculated with the probability addition rule,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A,B)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "given mutually explusive events we can generalize the addition rule as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P\\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Affine Correction**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Distribution Transformations](GeostatsPy_transformations): a distribution rescaling that can be thought of as shifting, and stretching or squeezing of a distribution. For the case of affien correction of $X$ to $Y$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x}(x_i - \\overline{x}) + \\overline{y}, \\quad \\forall \\quad i, \\ldots, n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see above that the affine correlation method first centers the distribution, the rescales the dispersion based on the ratio of the new standard deviation to the original standard deviation and then shifts the distribution to centered on the target mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* there is no shape change for affien correction. For shape change consider **Distribution Transformation** like **Gaussian Anamorphosis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Aniisotropic or Directional** (variogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation): variogram calculated or modelled such that direction (azimuth) is considered\n",
    "\n",
    "* for an anisotropic experimental variogram set the azimuth tolerance less than 90 degrees, then the experimental variogram is sensitive to direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* for an anisotropic variogram model set the major range greater than the minor range, then the variogram model is sensitive to direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Azimuth Tolerance** (variogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation): the tolerance $+/-\\Delta$ in azimuth applied to pool pairs of data for that specific azimuth.\n",
    "\n",
    "* for example, given an azimuth of 90 degrees (along the positive x axis in map view), we could assign an azimuth tolerance of 20 degrees and then all pairs with azimuths betwee 70 degrees and 110 degree will be pooled to calculate the experimental variogram for this azimuth\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is common practice for directional experimental variograms to use 22.5 degree, this result in a 45 degrees angle in the tolerance. This is seen as a good balance to provide smooth, interpretable variograms without mixing spatial continuity information over many directions\n",
    "  \n",
    "* this may be increased to smooth the experimental variogram for improved interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "* for isotropic (also called omnidirectional) experimental variograms (not sensitive to direction) use an azimuth tolerance of 90.0, resulting in 180 degrees angle in the tolerance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bandwidth** (variogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation): the maximum orthogonal deviation from the azimuth vector when identifying data pairs to calculate an experimental variogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "* at large lag distances with azimuth (dip) tolerance data could start to mix between stratigraphic units. Bandwith is typically applied to the vertical direction to reduce this mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* bandwidth should be set very large (to remove its influence) for isotropic (also called omnidirectional) variograms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bayesian Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): probabilities based on a degree of belief (expert experience) in an event,\n",
    "\n",
    "* updated as new information is available\n",
    "\n",
    "* solve probability problems that we cannot use simple frequencies, i.e., frequentist probablity approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayesian updating is modeled with **Bayes' Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bayes' Theorem** (probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): the mathematical model central to Bayesian probability for the Bayesian updating from prior probability, with likelihood probability from new information to posterior probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(A)$ is the prior, $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, $P(B)$ is the evidence term and $P(A|B)$ is the posterior. If is convenient to substitute more descriptive labels for A and B,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Model} | \\text{New Data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{New Data} | \\text{Model}) \\cdot P(\\text{Model})}{P(\\text{New Data})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Big Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): you have big data if your data has a combination of these criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Volume**: many data samples and features, difficult to store, transmit and visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Velocity** - high rate collection, continuous data collection relative to decision making cycles, challenges keeping up with the new data while updating the models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Variety** - data form various sources, with various types of data, types of information, and scales\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Variability** - data acquisition changes during the project, even for a single feature there may be multiple vintages of data with different scales, distributions and veracity\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Veracity** - data has various levels of accuracy, the data is not certain \n",
    "\n",
    "For most subsurface applications most if not all of these criteria are met. Subsurface engineering and geoscience is often working with big data!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Big Data Analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): the process of examining large and varied data sets to discover patterns and make decisions, the application of statistics to big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bootstrap**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Distribution Transformations](GeostatsPy_transformations): a statistical resampling procedure to calculate uncertainty in a calculated statistic from the sample data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* uses repeated ($L$ times) Monte Carlo simulations from the dataset CDF, repeated (number of data samples, $n$, times) samples from the sample data with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* calculates the entire distribution for uncertainty in any statistic, you calculate any summary statistic, e.g., mean, P10 and P90 of the uncertainty model\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply bootstrap to build the uncertainty distributions, predictor feature random variables (RVs), as the inputs for a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) workflow when that input is a statistic, e.g., average porosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a feature that can take be one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Nominal Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a **categorical** feature without any natural odering, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* facies = {boundstone, wackystone, packstone , Brecia}\n",
    "\n",
    "* minerals = {quartz, feldspar, clacite}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Categorical Ordinal Feature** \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* geologic age = {Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mohs hardness = ${1, 2, \\ldots, 10}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cell-based Declustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Declustering to Correct Sampling Bias](GeostatsPy_declustering): a declustering method to assign weights to spatial samples based on local sampling density, such that the weighted statistics are likely more representative of the population. Data weights are assigned so that,\n",
    "\n",
    "* samples in densely sampled areas receive less weight\n",
    "\n",
    "* samples in sparsely sampled areas receive more weight\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell-based declustering proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a cell mesh is placed over the spatial data and weights are set as proportional to the inverse of the number of samples in the mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the cell mesh size is varied and the cell size the minimizes the declustered mean (in the sample mean is biased high) or maximizes the declustered mean (if the sample mean is biased low)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. to remove the impact of cell mesh position, the cell mesh is randomly moved several times and the resulting weights are averaged for each datum\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w(\\bf{u}_j) = \\frac{1}{n_l} \\cdot \\frac{n}{L_o}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_l$ is the number of data in the current cell, $L_o$ is the number of cells with data, and $n$ is the total number of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some highlights for cell-based declustering,\n",
    "\n",
    "* expert judgement based on the nominal sample spacing (before infill) will improve the performance over the automated method for cell size selection based on minimum or maximum declustered mean\n",
    "\n",
    "* cell-based declustering is not aware of the boundaries of the area of interest; therefore, data near the boundary of the area of interest may appear to be more sparsely sampled and receive more weight\n",
    "\n",
    "* cell-based was developed by Professor Andre Journel in 1983, {cite}`journel1983`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Continuous Feature**\n",

    "* gold grade = ${4.56 g/t, 8.72 g/t, 12.45 g/t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Continuous, Interval Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a **continuous feature** where the intervals between numbers are equal, for example, the difference between 1.50 and 2.50 is the same as the difference between 2.50 and 3.50, but the values do not have an objective reality (exist on an arbitrary scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "* for example, Celsius scale of temperature (an arbitrary scale based on water freezing at 0 and boiling at 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Continuous, Ratio Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a **continuous feature** where the intervals between numbers are equal, for example, the difference between 1.50 and 2.50 is the same as the difference between 2.50 and 3.50, but the values do have an objective reality (measure an actual phenomenon)\n",
    "\n",
    "* for example, Kelvin scale of temperature, porosity, permeability, saturation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cognitive Biases**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): an automated (subconscious) thought process used by human brain to simplify information processing from large amount of personal experience and learned preferences. While these have been critical to our evolution on this planet, they can lead to the following issues in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Anchoring Bias**, too much emphasis on first piece of information. Studies have shown that first piece of information could be completely irrelevant as we were just starting to learning about the topic!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Availability Heuristic**, overestimate importance of information available to them, for example, “My grandpa smoked 3 packs a day and lived to 100”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bandwagon Effect**, probability increases with the number of people holding the belief \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Blind-spot Effect**, fail to see your own cognitive biases\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choice-supportive Bias**, probability increases after a commitment, decision is made\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Clustering Illusion**, seeing patterns in random events\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Confirmation Bias**, only consider new information that supports current model\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Conservatism Bias**, favor old data to newly collected data\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Recency Bias**, favor the most recently collected data\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Survivorship Bias**, focus on success cases only\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust use of statistics / data analytics protects use from bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Interpolate all distances and directions** - the variogram must be known for all possible $\\bf{h}$ lags, distances and directions, not just the limited lags calculated for the experimental variogram(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate geological knowledge** - the variogram modeling process is an opportunity integrate our geological knowledge. For example, geometric anisotropy ratios from knowledge of the depositional setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Valid model of difference vs. offset** - the variogram model must be positive definite (a legitimate measure of distance), that is, the variance of any linear combination must be positive. The variogram modeling workflow with additive, nested structures ensures this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for variogram modeling with nested structures to describe variance (sill) components are,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nugget effect** - assign as the single (lowest) isotropic nugget effect\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Number of structures** - choose the same number of variogram structures for all directions based on the most complex direction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contributions for each structure** - ensure that the same contribution parameter is used for each variogram structure in all directions and that the sum of all structures' contributions is equal to the sill (variance). Model to the sill and not above the sill.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apparent Nuggect Effect** - for apparent nugget effect structures (nugget effect in only some directions) use 0.0 range in the apparent nuggect effect directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geometric anisotropy** - vary the range parameters in each direction (anisotropy ratios)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Zonal anisotropy** - if the variogram does not reach the sill in some directions, then assign a very large value for the range in those directions to represent zonal anisotropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional comments to assist with variogram modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* initial coordinate and data transformation may be required, if the lags cross folded beds then the range will likely be underestimated\n",
    "  \n",
    "* focus on fundamental variogram interpretions including, trend, cyclicity, geometric anisotropy, and zonal anisotropy. If  trend is present, calculate a feature spatial trend model and then work with the residual model that does not have trend\n",
    "  \n",
    "* often the short scale structure is most important as most estimates and simulated realizations are interpolating between data. Data themselves often control long scale structures\n",
    "  \n",
    "* nugget effect due to measurement error should not be modeled, as it is not a feature of the geology. Nugget effect is very rare in oil and gas.\n",

    "[Variogram Calculation and Modeling](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation_and_modeling): variogram is very important in spatial data analytics, geostatistical study as the measure of geological (or other spatial feature) distance vs. spatial distance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Venn Diagrams** \n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability Concepts](GeostatsPy_probability): a plot, visual tool for communicating probability. What do we learn from a Venn diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "* size of regions $\\propto$ probability of occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "* proportion of $\\Omega$, all possible outcomes represented by a box, i.e., probability of $1.0$\n",
    "\n",
    "* overlap $\\propto$ probability of joint occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Venn diagrams are an excellent tool to visualize marginal, joint and conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Well Log Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): as a much cheaper method to sample wells that does not interupt drilling operations, well logs are very common over the wells. Often all wells have various well logs available. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* gamma ray on pilot vertical wells to assess the locations and quality of shales for targetting (landing) horizontal wells\n",
    "\n",
    "* neutron porosity to assess location high porosity reservoir sands\n",
    "\n",
    "* gamma ray in drill holes to map thorium mineralization\n",
    "\n",
    "well log data are critical to support subsurface resource interpretations. Once anchored by core data they provide the essential coverage and resolution to model the entire reservoir concept / framework for prediction, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* well log data callibrated by core data collocated with well log data are used to map the critical stratigraphic layers, including reservoir and seal units\n",
    "\n",
    "* well logs are applied to depth correct feature inverted from seismic that have location imprecision due to uncertainty in the rock velocity over the volume of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Well Log Data, Image Logs**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geostatistical Concepts](GeostatsPy_concepts): a special case of **well logs** where the well logs are repeated at various azimuthal intervals within the well bore resulting in a 2D (unwrapped) image instead of a 1D line along the well bore. For example, Fullbore formation MicroImager (FMI) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* with 80% bore hole coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0.2 inch (0.5 cm) resolution vertical and horizontal\n",
    "\n",
    "* 30 inch (79 cm) depth of investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "* observe lithology change, bed dips and sedimentary structures \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Zonal Anisotropy** (variogram model)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variogram Calculation and Modeling](GeostatsPy_variogram_calculation_and_modeling): when the experimental variogram does not reach the sill in a direction, i.e., the experimental levels out below the sill\n",
    "\n",
    "* zonal anisotropy is often paired with cyclicity or trend in the other (orthogonal) direction, e.g., zonal anisotropy in the major direction and trend in the minor direction\n",
    "  \n",
    "* the variance at which the variogram levels off is called an apparent sill\n",
