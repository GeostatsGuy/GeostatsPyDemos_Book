Michael Pyrcz, Professor, The University of Texas at Austin 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/geostatsguy) | [GitHub](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy) | [Website](http://michaelpyrcz.com) | [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QVZ20eQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) | [Book](https://www.amazon.com/Geostatistical-Reservoir-Modeling-Michael-Pyrcz/dp/0199731446) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLqEr-xV-ceHdXXXrTId5ig)  | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-pyrcz-61a648a1)

This e-book provides an accessible, online version, a new vehicle to share my **Data Analytics and Geostatistics Undergraduate Course** at The University of Texas at Austin, that includes, 

* **Well Documented Demonstration Python Workflows** - almost half the lecture time is spend with these workflows from my [GeostatsPyDemos](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPyDemos) GitHub repository, that includes well-documented demonstration Python Jupyter workflows for many common geostatistics workflows completed with my GeostatsPy python package. One goal of this e-book is to share this content beyond the GitHub users, often only the experts and developers - to reach and help more people!

* **Course Notes** - I'm also making an effort to continue adding more of the course notes into this e-book, to provid even more coverage of theory and implimentation details. 

* **Interactive Python Dashboards** - I have a lot of interactive Python dashboards that I use in my classes that I will continue to explain and cite in this e-book to help you get the entire in-class experience. These are all available in my [DataScienceInteractivePython](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/DataScienceInteractivePython) GitHub repository.

* **Recorded Lectures** - there are many thousands of views of my lectures every month on [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/GeostatsGuyLectures), but many of those people are not on GitHub. I will add links to this e-book to support them. Also, the YouTube channel can enhance the e-book experience, read the book and drop by to hear my explanations. 

```{admonition} Welcome!
:class: remove-from-content-only

The goal of this e-book is to teach the application of geostatistics in Python, for those new to geostatistics I provide theory and links to my course content, and for those experienced practitioners I provide example workflows and plots that you can implement.
```

This is my first attempt to convert my repository of well-documented Python workflows, [GeostatsPyDemos: GeostatsPy Python Package for Spatial Data Analytics and Geostatistics Demonstration Workflows Repository](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPyDemos) {cite}`pyrczdemos2024` into an online e-book. 

* this e-book provides the essential theory to complete standard geostatistical workflow steps

* while I make an effort to include foundamental concepts such as geostatistical concepts, probability, univariate statistics, etc. I have yet to include all the concent from my Data Analytics and Geostatistics Undergraduate Course.  

For a more complete treatment I invite you to refer to a standard textbook like, 

* [Geostatistical Reservoir Modeling](https://a.co/d/4tspALH) {cite}`pyrcz2014`. 

Alternatively, you can review the linked lectures from my,

* [Data Analytics and Geostatistics Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG19vXLQHvSB-D4XKYieEku9GQMQyAzjJ&si=zBls7dCMaYLzraoe) {cite}`pyrczyoutube` 

for a deeper dive into the theory and practice of geostatistics. Also, I have a recent book chapter that summarizes GeostatsPy, [GeostatsPy: Open-Source Geostatistics in Python](https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/89590){cite}`pyrczchapter2024` that may be helpful.

```{admonition} Linked Recorded Lectures are Available
:class: remove-from-content-only

For a deeper dive into the theory and practice of geostatistics follow the links at the top of each chapter to my recorded YouTube lectures.
```

All the original geostatistics Python Jupyter notebook workflows are available in my [GeostatsPyDemos](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPyDemos) GitHub repository.

<h3 align="center">Approximately 40 Well-Documented Spatial Data Analytics and Geostatistics Workflows with the GeostatsPy Package!</h3>

* It is challenging to learn a new Python package. For me, great examples for common workflows are critical. So I built out over 40 well-documented demonstration workflows that apply GeostatsPy to accomplish common spatial modeling tasks to support my students in my courses:

1. [Data Analytics and Geostatistics Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG19vXLQHvSB-D4XKYieEku9GQMQyAzjJ&si=MzTdgS7IfHEhvF4Q) {cite}`pyrczyoutube`
2. [Spatial Data Analytics Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG19vXLQHvSDUmEOmBoaxGbFAbvaLdfx4&si=Pd9bNQLVFZ9Yqz6-)
3. [Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG19vXLQHvSC2ZKFIkgVpI9fCjkN38kwf&si=tfOVljWgWiduwGYl)

* Note, I have made modifications to improve the formatting in the book, including the simplification of the workflow headers and suppression of diagnostic output and status bars during model run.

#### Recent Updates

Here's some highlights from recent updates:

##### What's New with Version 0.0.1

* there are many minor formatting issues that I will resolve over the next couple of months.
* I will be looking at practice methods to integrate my [Interactive Educational Data Science Python Dashboards](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/DataScienceInteractivePython) interactive dashboards {cite}`pyrczdemos2021`, and more from my [Data Analytics and Geostatistics Lecture Series](https://www.amazon.com/Geostatistical-Reservoir-Modeling-Michael-Pyrcz/dp/0199731446/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?crid=3ED1DD48WEOWY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Zc8BcsVFjZWavjbNy9lsWGaxzrh1IbDo_8cC252-nSoYSry6LMr4MhaEEpxz35qu.T6Wztji_XQB6K-vAL0kGZFPNBMAu0iK75zaAU2tNLH4&dib_tag=se&keywords=geostatistics+pyrcz&qid=1723129932&sprefix=geostatistics+pyrcz%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1-fkmr0) {cite}`pyrczyoutube`.

Yet, I'm excited to compile all this content into an accessible format, linked to lectures and with repeatable code. My goal is to help folks get started and improve their application of geostatistics. With an e-book, I realize the dream of sharing educational content with:

* **living documents**, I will continuously make improvements and add new content over time, so send me suggestions and errata and return often!
* **repeatable results**, all examples and plots show the code and anyone can reproduce all the results! The code is immediately downloadable, and all data are online available.
* **links** for rapid access to all associated resources.
* **no pay wall** for anyone around the world to access my content.

For me, this is a wonderful vehicle to combine and share all my educational content. Yes, thousands can follow my workflows on GitHub, but the e-book will share this content much more widely. Accessible and actionable educational content is my personal mantra. Some might wonder, why does Michael do this? Check out my story and you will learn that education changed my life. I grew up in a low income family in a small town in Canada. In middle school (junior high for my Canadian friends), I delivered newspapers for over a year to save up for my first computer that our school guidance councilor helped me buy at a local used computer store. A random engineering student talked to me in a gas station late one cold evening and that got me interested in an university education. Education changed my life, so it is my mission to share all my university educational content. Perhaps, I may lift someone as I was lifted. 

Before we get started, here's more information about the associated repository, the source of the workflows for this e-book.

#### The Workflow Repository

The [GeostatsPyDemos: GeostatsPy Python Package for Spatial Data Analytics and Geostatistics Demonstration Workflows Repository](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPyDemos){cite}`pyrczdemos2024` hosts more than 40 well-documented demonstration workflow for common geostatistical workflows with GeostatsPy. 

* utilizing synthetic data from my [GeoDataSets](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets) repository
* small and often 2D examples for fast run times and ease of interpretation
* often used and cited in my courses for repeatable educational content

Common geostatistical workflows that are included:

* data visualization
* distribution transformation
* spatial data debiasing with declustering
* spatial continuity calculation and modeling with variograms
* spatial estimation
* spatial trend modeling
* spatial simulation
* indicator based estimation and simulation
* cosimulation with secondary data
* summarization over multiple simulated realizations
* spatial model checking
* volume variance relations

#### How to Use this e-book?

This is a topical approach to the hands-on application of geostatistics. Each chapter stands alone and covers a unique demonstration or workflow using GeostatsPy. Want to visualize univariate distributions, debias your spatial data with declustering, make estimates in space with kriging or simulate a spatial heterogeneity model? Open up the respective chapter and walkthrough the example with all requisite steps, including data loading, data visualization and geostatistics steps, all codes and results shown. Go to the linked lecture to fill any gaps in your knowledge and then download and update the workflow for your application, please remember to cite the e-book in your work, so that others will see and use this resource! Remember, that this content is for educational purposes only and I do not provide any guarantees. There may be errors in the codes, there may be issues with your case that invalidate the assumptions of the e-book's workflows. It is up to you to evaluate your results.

```{warning}
If you adopt any workflows from this e-book or any codes from the GeostatsPy Python package you must check your own work.
```

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope this content is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface, spatial modeling, data analytics and geostatistics. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate. I'm happy to collaborate with your organization.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and / or consulting? I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
